Hi! I’m Ziyang Xu (徐子扬, StatXzy7), a final-year (senior) undergraduate student at School of Mathematics and Statistics, Lanzhou University, majoring in Statistics.

I intend to pursue my Ph.D. degree in Mathematics at Department of Mathematics, The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) from Sept. 2024, advised by Prof. [Tieyong Zeng](https://www.math.cuhk.edu.hk/~zeng/).

My research interests used to be Deep Learning, Statistical Machine Learning, Bioinformatics, Medical Image Processing. Currently I'm looking for some interesting scientific or application problems that have a chance to be solved by AI, so that I can devote myself to them.

You can find my CV here: [Ziyang Xu's Curriculum Vitae](../files/CV ZiyangXu.pdf). 
Feel free to reach out if you want to chat or collaborate!

======
- PTransIPs: Identification of phosphorylation sites enhanced by protein PLM embeddings[[PDF]](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10472595) [[Code]](https://github.com/StatXzy7/PTransIPs).

   Ziyang Xu†, Haitian Zhong†, Bingrui He, Xueying Wang, Tianchi Lu.  Accepted by IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics (J-BHI) (SCI Q1, 中科院一区, IF=7.7)
  - Co-author: [Haitian Zhong](https://jzsawyer.github.io/), [Tianchi Lu](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Tianchi-Lu-3)
  - PTransIPs, a new deep learning framework for the identification of phosphorylation sites. PTransIPs utilizes protein pre-trained language model (PLM) embeddings to achieve SOTA performance, with AUCs of 0.9232 and 0.9660 for S/T and Y sites, respectively. PTransIPs is also a universal framework for all peptide bioactivity tasks.
