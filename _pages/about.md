# Publications

- PTransIPs: Identification of phosphorylation sites enhanced by protein PLM embeddings[[PDF]](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10472595) [[Code]](https://github.com/StatXzy7/PTransIPs) <span class="show_paper_citations" data="paper1">| Citations: Loading...</span>

  Ziyang Xu†, Haitian Zhong†, Bingrui He, Xueying Wang, Tianchi Lu.  Accepted by IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics (J-BHI) (SCI Q1, 中科院一区, IF=7.7)

  - Co-author: [Haitian Zhong](https://jzsawyer.github.io/), [Tianchi Lu](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Tianchi-Lu-3)
  - PTransIPs, a new deep learning framework for the identification of phosphorylation sites. PTransIPs utilizes protein pre-trained language model (PLM) embeddings to achieve SOTA performance, with AUCs of 0.9232 and 0.9660 for S/T and Y sites, respectively. PTransIPs is also a universal framework for all peptide bioactivity tasks.
